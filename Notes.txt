
1. Steps we need to follow before approaching any ML Project (Complete Project)
2. Airflow Revison (Scheduler) 
3. Parallel Training
4. Docker
5. Deployment




Machine Learning Development in Cloud

Vertex AI(Google), 
Azure Machine Learning Studio(Microsoft), 
Sagemaker(AWS)



How to start Machine Learning Project?

1. Python

Data Structure
List Queue Dictionary Set Tuple
Function
*args,**kwargs
OOPS:
Class:  
	Attribute or Property (Public, Private and Protected)
	function


Library System (College):
Real Entity			OOPS (Class)			Database (Table)
BooK 				BOOK					BOOK
Student				Student					Student
Librarian			Librarian				Librarian
Author				Author					Author
BookCategory		BookCategory			BookCategory
BookDistribution	BookDistribution		BookDistribution


Understand Relation Between Entity:

User
Student
Librarian
Author


IS A ()
HAS A ()

UserType(PK)  User(FK) 
one to many

Python (ENum)
Abstract
Interface




User has a UserType





Decorator:
Example


Logging 

We want to log

Function Name along with their parameter
Start Time
End Time
Total Duration of function execution


Create a decorator
@logDetail


Exception
and
Logging

-----We know Python---


ML Project (Recommendation)
ML Regression ()Foresting 
ML Classification () 

Loan should be approved or not 
Transaction is legitimate or not
Classifiction about valid user or not 
Mail verification 


ML CLustering

Sensor Fault Detection

1. Reading of sensors (100)
XYZ company build an product which contains sensors

Product Maintainace is require or not
Warranty or Gurranty

1. Reliability
2. Trust
3. GoodWill
4. Inspect Design and Recommendation for Re engineering to improve product

2 to 3 In building any Product 

Initial Data they will analyze it

Ready to launch product in the market


Inital Data (Model)---> Maintainace required or not


Complete track of record of sensor along with timestamp how it change after what time
and which sensor reading range will make product in bad condition

6 Month --> Warranty (4 Hour ) --> 

Anaomly Detection/Classification

Whether you product need maintainance or not before it gets into badcondition

Data Collection--> Continous proccess

Data Engineering Team (Handling Big Data is required) Cluster
Capture the data and send these data to company server

Streaming--> Kafka

Data Scientist Team

100 Sensors
D1------->  K
			A
			F
D2------>	K
			A


D1M---->





Training Data is in Data Lake 

Prediction data --> new file which will specify detail customer where to send 
engineers for maintainance of the product.


What is Data Lake

Distributed File Storage System

S3 Bucket
Google Cloud Storage ()
Storage Account (Container, FIle Share, Queues and Table)

Blob Storage 

Binary Large Object

Hadoop

PySpark: Data Bricks 
PySpark: Distributed Framework 

Data Transformation and Model trainomg

Python, PySPARK and SQL-->
